#rmanuals (well, nearly)

This is not my stuff!, it's a centralised point to get at the R reference manuals!

o why tje "nearly" .. becase there's other stuff here: such as stata manuals, and, oh
the online stats book from Rice Uni.
BTW the datasets are not there, you have to go to the website https://onlinestatbook.com
to get those. 

However, they ARE listed. What good is that you might say?
Hmmm .. take a look at the name of dataset no .3 and you'll under sand why :-)
