org.Hs.egALIAS2EG

Map between Common Gene Symbol Identifiers and Entrez Gene

Description
org.Hs.egALIAS is an R object that provides mappings between common gene symbol identifiers
and entrez gene identifiers.
Details
Each gene symbol maps to a named vector containing the corresponding entrez gene identifier. The
name of the vector corresponds to the gene symbol. Since gene symbols are sometimes redundantly
assigned in the literature, users are cautioned that this map may produce multiple matching results
for a single gene symbol. Users should map back from the entrez gene IDs produced to determine
which result is the one they want when this happens.
Because of this problem with redundant assigment of gene symbols, is it never advisable to use
gene symbols as primary identifiers.
This mapping includes ALL gene symbols including those which are already listed in the SYMBOL
map. The SYMBOL map is meant to only list official gene symbols, while the ALIAS maps are
meant to store all used symbols.

org.Hs.egCHRLOC

Entrez Gene IDs to Chromosomal Location

Description
org.Hs.egCHRLOC is an R object that maps entrez gene identifiers to the starting position of the
gene. The position of a gene is measured as the number of base pairs.
The CHRLOCEND mapping is the same as the CHRLOC mapping except that it specifies the
ending base of a gene instead of the start.
Details
Each entrez gene identifier maps to a named vector of chromosomal locations, where the name
indicates the chromosome.
Chromosomal locations on both the sense and antisense strands are measured as the number of base
pairs from the p (5’ end of the sense strand) to q (3’ end of the sense strand) arms. Chromosomal
locations on the antisense strand have a leading "-" sign (e. g. -1234567).
Since some genes have multiple start sites, this field can map to multiple locations.

org.Hs.egENSEMBL

Map Ensembl gene accession numbers with Entrez Gene identifiers

Description
org.Hs.egENSEMBL is an R object that contains mappings between Entrez Gene identifiers and
Ensembl gene accession numbers.
Details
This object is a simple mapping of Entrez Gene identifiers https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene to Ensembl gene Accession Numbers.
Mappings were based on data provided by BOTH of these sources: http://www.ensembl.org/
biomart/martview/ ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA
For most species, this mapping is a combination of NCBI to ensembl IDs from BOTH NCBI and
ensembl. Users who wish to only use mappings from NCBI are encouraged to see the ncbi2ensembl
table in the appropriate organism package. Users who wish to only use mappings from ensembl are
encouraged to see the ensembl2ncbi table which is also found in the appropriate organism packages.
These mappings are based upon the ensembl table which is contains data from BOTH of these
sources in an effort to maximize the chances that you will find a match.
For worms and flies however, this mapping is based only on sources from ensembl, as these organisms do not have ensembl to entrez gene mapping data at NCBI.

org.Hs.egENZYME

Map between Entrez Gene IDs and Enzyme Commission (EC) Numbers

Description
org.Hs.egENZYME is an R object that provides mappings between entrez gene identifiers and EC
numbers.
Details
Each entrez gene identifier maps to a named vector containing the EC number that corresponds
to the enzyme produced by that gene. The name corresponds to the entrez gene identifier. If this
information is unknown, the vector will contain an NA.
Enzyme Commission numbers are assigned by the Nomenclature Committee of the International
Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology http://www.chem.qmw.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/ to
allow enzymes to be identified.
An Enzyme Commission number is of the format EC x.y.z.w, where x, y, z, and w are numeric
numbers. In org.Hs.egENZYME2EG, EC is dropped from the Enzyme Commission numbers.

10

org.Hs.egENZYME
Enzyme Commission numbers have corresponding names that describe the functions of enzymes
in such a way that EC x is a more general description than EC x.y that in turn is a more general
description than EC x.y.z. The top level EC numbers and names are listed below:
EC 1 oxidoreductases
EC 2 transferases
EC 3 hydrolases
EC 4 lyases
EC 5 isomerases
EC 6 ligases
The EC name for a given EC number can be viewed at http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/
jcbn/index.html#6
Mappings between entrez gene identifiers and enzyme identifiers were obtained using files provided
by: KEGG GENOME ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/genomes With a date stamp from the source of:
2011-Mar15
For the reverse map, each EC number maps to a named vector containing the entrez gene identifier
that corresponds to the gene that produces that enzyme. The name of the vector corresponds to the
EC number.

Map between Entrez Gene IDs and Genes

Description
org.Hs.egGENENAME is an R object that maps entrez gene identifiers to the corresponding gene
name.
Details
Each entrez gene identifier maps to a named vector containing the gene name. The vector name
corresponds to the entrez gene identifier. If the gene name is unknown, the vector will contain an
NA.

Maps between Entrez Gene IDs and Gene Ontology (GO) IDs

Description
org.Hs.egGO is an R object that provides mappings between entrez gene identifiers and the GO
identifiers that they are directly associated with. This mapping and its reverse mapping do NOT
associate the child terms from the GO ontology with the gene. Only the directly evidenced terms
are represented here.
org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS is an R object that provides mappings between a given GO identifier and
all of the Entrez Gene identifiers annotated at that GO term OR TO ONE OF IT’S CHILD NODES
in the GO ontology. Thus, this mapping is much larger and more inclusive than org.Hs.egGO2EG.
Details
If org.Hs.egGO is cast as a list, each Entrez Gene identifier is mapped to a list of lists. The names on
the outer list are GO identifiers. Each inner list consists of three named elements: GOID, Ontology,
and Evidence.
The GOID element matches the GO identifier named in the outer list and is included for convenience
when processing the data using ’lapply’.
The Ontology element indicates which of the three Gene Ontology categories this identifier belongs
to. The categories are biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function
(MF).
The Evidence element contains a code indicating what kind of evidence supports the association of
the GO identifier to the Entrez Gene id. Some of the evidence codes in use include:
IMP: inferred from mutant phenotype
IGI: inferred from genetic interaction
IPI: inferred from physical interaction
ISS: inferred from sequence similarity
IDA: inferred from direct assay
IEP: inferred from expression pattern
IEA: inferred from electronic annotation
TAS: traceable author statement
NAS: non-traceable author statement
ND: no biological data available
IC: inferred by curator
A more complete listing of evidence codes can be found at:
http://www.geneontology.org/GO.evidence.shtml
If org.Hs.egGO2ALLEGS or org.Hs.egGO2EG is cast as a list, each GO term maps to a named vector of entrez gene identifiers and evidence codes. A GO identifier may be mapped to the same entrez

14

org.Hs.egGO
gene identifier more than once but the evidence code can be different. Mappings between Gene Ontology identifiers and Gene Ontology terms and other information are available in a separate data
package named GO.
Whenever any of these mappings are cast as a data.frame, all the results will be output in an appropriate tabular form.
Mappings between entrez gene identifiers and GO information were obtained through their mappings to Entrez Gene identifiers. NAs are assigned to entrez gene identifiers that can not be mapped
to any Gene Ontology information. Mappings between Gene Ontology identifiers an Gene Ontology terms and other information are available in a separate data package named GO.
All mappings were based on data provided by: Gene Ontology http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/gobasic.obo With a date stamp from the source of: 2021-09-01
For GO2ALL style mappings, the intention is to return all the genes that are the same kind of
term as the parent term (based on the idea that they are more specific descriptions of the general
term). However because of this intent, not all relationship types will be counted as offspring for this
mapping. Only "is a" and "has a" style relationships indicate that the genes from the child terms
would be the same kind of thing.

org.Hs.egMAP

Map between Entrez Gene Identifiers and cytogenetic maps/bands

Description
org.Hs.egMAP is an R object that provides mappings between entrez gene identifiers and cytoband
locations.
Details
Each entrez gene identifier is mapped to a vector of cytoband locations. The vector length may
be one or longer, if there are multiple reported chromosomal locations for a given gene. An NA is
reported for any entrez gene identifiers that cannot be mapped to a cytoband at this time.
Cytogenetic bands for most higher organisms are labeled p1, p2, p3, q1, q2, q3 (p and q are the p
and q arms), etc., counting from the centromere out toward the telomeres. At higher resolutions,
sub-bands can be seen within the bands. The sub-bands are also numbered from the centromere out
toward the telomere. Thus, a label of 7q31.2 indicates that the band is on chromosome 7, q arm,
band 3, sub-band 1, and sub-sub-band 2.

Number of mapped keys for the maps in package org.Hs.eg.db

Description
org.Hs.egMAPCOUNTS provides the "map count" (i.e. the count of mapped keys) for each map in
package org.Hs.eg.db.
Details
This "map count" information is precalculated and stored in the package annotation DB. This allows
some quality control and is used by the checkMAPCOUNTS function defined in AnnotationDbi to compare and validate different methods (like count.mappedkeys(x) or sum(!is.na(as.list(x))))
for getting the "map count" of a given map.

org.Hs.egPATH

Mappings between Entrez Gene identifiers and KEGG pathway identifiers

Description
KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) maintains pathway data for various organisms. org.Hs.egPATH maps entrez gene identifiers to the identifiers used by KEGG for pathways
Details
Each KEGG pathway has a name and identifier. Pathway name for a given pathway identifier can
be obtained using the KEGG data package that can either be built using AnnBuilder or downloaded
from Bioconductor http://www.bioconductor.org.
Graphic presentations of pathways are searchable at url http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/pathway.html
by using pathway identifiers as keys.
Mappings were based on data provided by: KEGG GENOME ftp://ftp.genome.jp/pub/kegg/genomes

org.Hs.egPFAM

Maps between Manufacturer Identifiers and PFAM Identifiers

Description
org.Hs.egPFAM is an R object that provides mappings between manufacturer identifiers and PFAM
identifiers.
Details
The bimap interface for PFAM is defunct. Please use select() interface to PFAM identifiers. See
?AnnotationDbi::select for details.
org.Hs.egPMID

Map between Entrez Gene Identifiers and PubMed Identifiers

Description
org.Hs.egPMID is an R object that provides mappings between entrez gene identifiers and PubMed
identifiers.
Details
Each entrez gene identifier is mapped to a named vector of PubMed identifiers. The name associated
with each vector corresponds to the entrez gene identifier. The length of the vector may be one or
greater, depending on how many PubMed identifiers a given entrez gene identifier is mapped to. An
NA is reported for any entrez gene identifier that cannot be mapped to a PubMed identifier.
Titles, abstracts, and possibly full texts of articles can be obtained from PubMed by providing a
valid PubMed identifier. The pubmed function of annotate can also be used for the same purpose.

org.Hs.egREFSEQ

Map between Entrez Gene Identifiers and RefSeq Identifiers

Description
org.Hs.egREFSEQ is an R object that provides mappings between entrez gene identifiers and RefSeq identifiers.
Details
Each entrez gene identifier is mapped to a named vector of RefSeq identifiers. The name represents
the entrez gene identifier and the vector contains all RefSeq identifiers that can be mapped to that
entrez gene identifier. The length of the vector may be one or greater, depending on how many
RefSeq identifiers a given entrez gene identifier can be mapped to. An NA is reported for any entrex
gene identifier that cannot be mapped to a RefSeq identifier at this time.
RefSeq identifiers differ in format according to the type of record the identifiers are for as shown
below:
NG\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for genomic region (nucleotide) records
NM\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for mRNA records
NC\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for chromosome records
NP\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for protein records
XR\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for model RNAs that are not associated with protein products
XM\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for model mRNA records
XP\_XXXXX: RefSeq accessions for model protein records
Where XXXXX is a sequence of integers.
NCBI https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/ allows users to query the RefSeq database using RefSeq identifiers.

org.Hs.egSYMBOL

Map between Entrez Gene Identifiers and Gene Symbols

Description
org.Hs.egSYMBOL is an R object that provides mappings between entrez gene identifiers and gene
abbreviations.

24

org.Hs.egSYMBOL

Details
Each entrez gene identifier is mapped to the a common abbreviation for the corresponding gene. An
NA is reported if there is no known abbreviation for a given gene.
Symbols typically consist of 3 letters that define either a single gene (ABC) or multiple genes
(ABC1, ABC2, ABC3). Gene symbols can be used as key words to query public databases such as
Entrez Gene.

This mapping has been deprecated and will no longer be available
after bioconductor 2.6. See the details section for how you can live
without it. For now, it is a map of UCSC "Known Gene" accession
numbers with Entrez Gene identifiers

Description
org.Hs.egUCSCKG is an R object that contains mappings between Entrez Gene identifiers and
UCSC "Known Gene" accession numbers.
Details
This object is a simple mapping of Entrez Gene identifiers https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene to UCSC "Known Gene" Accession Numbers. Please be advised
that UCSC "Known Genes" are not more like putative transcripts transcript identifiers than they are
gene identifiers.
Mappings were based on data provided by: UCSC Genome Bioinformatics (Homo sapiens)
With a date stamp from the source of: 2021-Jul20
This mapping is based on the very latest build available at UCSC for this organism as of March
2010. 2.6 is the last release where you can expect it to be here. The GenomicFeatures package
contains functionality that replaces the need for this mapping. Please see the GenomicFeatures
vignette for details on how to use it.
